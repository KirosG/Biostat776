# Principles of Analytic Graphics

Principle 1: Show comparisons

* Evidence for an hypothesis is always **relative** to another competing hypothesis

* Always ask "Compared to What?"

# Show Comparisons

* Always ask "Compared to What?"

Principe 2: Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure

* What is your causal framework for thinking about a question?

# Show Causality, Mechanism

Principle 3: Show multivariate data

* Multivariate = more than 2 variables
* The real world is multivariate
* Need to "escape flatland"


# Show Multivariate Data

# Principles of Analytic Graphics

Principle 4: Integrate Evidence

* Completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams
* Data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation
* Don't let the tool drive the analysis

# Principles of Analytic Graphics

Principle 4: Integrate Evidence

* Completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams
* Data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation
* Don't let the tool drive the analysis


Principle 5: Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, etc.

* A data graphic should tell a complete story that is credible
* Same is true for a slide in a presentation

# Document the Evidence

Principle 6: Content is king

* Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the *quality*, *relevance*, and *integrity* of their content
