### Homework collaboration

Please feel free to study together and talk to one another about
homework assignments. The mutual instruction that students give each
other is among the most valuable that can be achieved. However, it is
expected that homework assignments will be implemented and written up
independently unless otherwise specified. Specifically, please do not
share analytic code or output. Please do not collaborate on write-up
and interpretation. Please do not access or use solutions from any
source before your homework assignment is submitted for grading.
