This course covers programming and other computer skills required
  for the research and application of statistical methods. The focus
  will be on programming in the R language; we will cover the basic
  language elements and methods for software development in R. We will
  also cover computing topics such as coding best practices, version
  control, copyright law, and graphics.

## Textbooks

The following books will be used in the course and are available free
from Leanpub.com:

* [R Programming for Data Science](https://leanpub.com/rprogramming),
  by Roger D. Peng (you can also read this book [on the web](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/))

* [Exploratory Data Analysis with R](https://leanpub.com/exdata), by
  Roger D. Peng (you can read this book [on the web](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/exdata/))

* [Report Writing for Data Science in
  R](https://leanpub.com/reportwriting), by Roger D. Peng

* [Mastering Software Development in
  R](https://leanpub.com/msdr), by Roger D. Peng, Sean Kross,
  and G. Brooke Anderson (you can read this book [on the web](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/RProgDA/))

The following books may also be useful and is available in web format only:

* [R Programming for Research](https://geanders.github.io/RProgrammingForResearch/), by G. Brooke Anderson and Rachel Severson


## Software

We will make heavy use of R in this course, so you should have R installed. You can obtain R from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org). There are versions available for Mac, Windows, and Unix/Linux. This software is **required** for this course.	

I will also make use of the RStudio interactive development environment (IDE). RStudio requires that R be installed, and so is an "add-on" to R. I **strongly** recommend that you install this software. You can obtain the RStudio Desktop from the [RStudio web site](https://www.rstudio.com/). In particular, we will make haevy use of it when developing packages.

## Homework

There will be 3 assignments, due roughly every 3 weeks. Homeworks will be
submitted electronically via the Drop Box on the CoursePlus web site.

The homework assignments will be due on 

* Homework 1: September 21, 11:59pm
* Homework 2: October 12, 11:59pm
* Homework 3: October 26, 11:59pm

### Homework collaboration

Please feel free to study together and talk to one another about
homework assignments. The mutual instruction that students give each
other is among the most valuable that can be achieved. However, it is
expected that homework assignments will be implemented and written up
independently unless otherwise specified. Specifically, please do not
share analytic code or output. Please do not collaborate on write-up
and interpretation. Please do not access or use solutions from any
source before your homework assignment is submitted for grading.

## Exams

There are no exams in this course.

## Grading

Grades in the course will be based on the three submitted homeworks with a percentage of the final grade being apportioned to each assignment. Each assignment counts equally in the final grade. Grades for the homeworks and the final grade will be issued via the CoursePlus grade book.

## Academic Ethics and Student Conduct Code

Students enrolled in the Bloomberg School of Public Health of The Johns Hopkins University assume an obligation to conduct themselves in a manner appropriate to the University's mission as an institution of higher education. A student is obligated to refrain from acts which he or she knows, or under the circumstances has reason to know, impair the academic integrity of the University. Violations of academic integrity include, but are not limited to: cheating; plagiarism; knowingly furnishing false information to any agent of the University for inclusion in the academic record; violation of the rights and welfare of animal or human subjects in research; and misconduct as a member of either School or University committees or recognized groups or organizations.

Students should be familiar with the policies and procedures specified under Policy and Procedure Manual Student-01 (Academic Ethics), available on the school’s [portal](http://my.jhsph.edu).

The faculty, staff and students of the Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins University have the shared responsibility to conduct themselves in a manner that upholds the law and respects the rights of others. Students enrolled in the School are subject to the Student Conduct Code (detailed in Policy and Procedure Manual Student-06) and assume an obligation to conduct themselves in a manner which upholds the law and respects the rights of others. They are responsible for maintaining the academic integrity of the institution and for preserving an environment conducive to the safe pursuit of the School's educational, research, and professional practice missions.

## Disability Support Services

If you are a student with a documented disability who requires an academic accommodation, please contact the Office of Disability Support Services at 410-502-6602 or via email at `JHSPH.dss@jhu.edu`. Accommodations take effect upon approval and apply to the remainder of the time for which a student is registered and enrolled at the Bloomberg School of Public Health.
